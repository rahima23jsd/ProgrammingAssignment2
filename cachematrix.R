## The first function, makeCacheMatrix, creates a special "matrix" object
## that can cache its inverse
## The second function, cacheSolve, computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
## returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated 
## and the matrix has not changed, then cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from 
## the cache

## This function is a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setInv <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getInv <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setInv = setInv,
         getInv = getInv)
}


## This function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the 
## function above. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already
## been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the
## computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets
## the value of the inverse in the cache via the setInv function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    m <- x$getInv()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setInv(m)
    m
}
